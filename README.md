# Bunsen

Periodic Bunsen is a free & open-source CLI tool used to work with chemistry and its different fields & aspects. It was originally created to help students with their chemistry homework, but it can be used by anyone who wants to learn more about chemistry. It is simple, user-friendly, and readily-available for anyone to use. It is written in C and is currently only available for Windows.

### Update

Bunsen was last worked on in 2022, and it is now 2024! I am reviving this project and will be working on it again. I will be adding more features and fixing bugs, along with working on improving my really bad code. I will also be working on a new version of Bunsen once this one is finished. I will be working on this project for the next few months, so stay tuned for updates! (Check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more info.)

## Usage

Periodic Bunsen is a CLI tool, and is designed to be used in the terminal. There are different commands, some requiring arguments, that can be used to perform different tasks. To get a list of all the commands, run `bunsen help` in the terminal. To get help with a specific command, run `bunsen help <command>`.

To build bunsen, go to your specified version folder in the `src` folder and view the `README.md` file for instructions. You can also view the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) file for more info.
