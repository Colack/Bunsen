# Bunsen

Periodic Bunsen is a free & open-source CLI tool used to work with chemistry and its different fields & aspects. It was originally created to help students with their chemistry homework, but it can be used by anyone who wants to learn more about chemistry. It is simple, user-friendly, and readily-available for anyone to use. It is written in C and is currently only available for Windows.

### Update

Bunsen was last worked on in 2022, and it is now 2024! I am reviving this project and will be working on it again. I will be adding more features and fixing bugs, along with working on improving my really bad code. I will also be working on a new version of Bunsen once this one is finished. I will be working on this project for the next few months, so stay tuned for updates! (Check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more info.)

## Usage

Periodic Bunsen is a CLI tool, and is designed to be used in the terminal. There are different commands, some requiring arguments, that can be used to perform different tasks. To get a list of all the commands, run `bunsen help` in the terminal. To get help with a specific command, run `bunsen help <command>`.

To build bunsen, go to your specified version folder in the `src` folder and view the `README.md` file for instructions. You can also view the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) file for more info.

## Putting Bunsen on your PATH

Until I can figure out how to make an installer, you will have to put Bunsen on your PATH manually. To do this, follow the instructions below:

Windows:

1. Open the folder where you downloaded Bunsen.
2. Copy the path to the folder.
3. Open the start menu and search for "environment variables".
4. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
5. Click on "Environment Variables...".
6. Under "System variables", click on "Path" and then click "Edit...".
7. Click "New" and paste the path to the folder where you downloaded Bunsen.
8. Click "OK" on all the windows to save your changes.
